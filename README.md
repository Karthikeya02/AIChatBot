## AI Chat Bot
#### The purpose of this repo is to:
Develop an AI Chatbot that provides support and guidance to students experiencing mental health issues.
Issues related to anxiety, stress, and depression, among other mental health challenges.
Leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a user-centered approach. 
Directs students to relevant mental health resources, such as helpline numbers and counseling services. 
Privacy and security measures are implemented to protect user data, ensuring confidentiality. 
While the Chatbot aims to be a helpful tool, it explicitly emphasizes that it is not a substitute for professional assistance, urging users to seek appropriate help when needed.
